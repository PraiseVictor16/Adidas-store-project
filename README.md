# Adidas Store Project
# Store Background
The Adidas US Store, a subsidiary of the Adidas Group, specializes in the sales of men’s apparel, women’s apparel, men’s athletic footwear, women’s athletic footwear and the likes. Data has been gathered on the sales of these products including the number of units sold, total sales revenue, the location of the sales, the type of product sold, and any other relevant information.
# Project Task
The purpose of the analysis is to evaluate the sales trends in the Adidas US stores in each city and region of the country. This was done to understand the behavioural pattern and purchasing habits of their customers, identify successful products and marketing campaigns and to also develop strategies for future sales. 
# Methodology
The methodology used in this analysis involved Microsoft Excel for data cleaning. No null or duplicate values were found in this data, however, additional columns were added to gain more insights into the data and provide answers to the analytical questions. The added columns are 'Day' and 'Month'. After the process of data cleaning, Microsoft Excel’s Pivot Table and Chart were used to visualize the data. 
# Results/Findings
* The best performing region in the US Stores is the Western region making the most sales worth $269,943,182.
* From the daily slaes pattern, it can br deduced that the most productive day is Friday.
* Most customers (about 51%) prefer to shop online.
* The best selling product is the Men’s Street Footwear making sales worth $208,826,244.
* The top performing cities in terms of profit are Charleston, making the most profit and New York following behind.
# Recommendations 
* With Friday being the day most sales are made in a week, each store should ensure there’s no shortage of any product that particular day. The staff members should also be readily on site to attend to every customer.
* Knowing most customers purchase products online, the store’s website should be well-functioning 24/7. Ads can also be created for more publicity and sales promotion.
* The best selling product till date remains the Men’s Street footwear, therefore, each store branch in the US should always have this product in stock.
* Since Charleston is the most performing city in terms of profit, the sales strategy used should be shared with the store branches in cities that are not as profitable.
* Further analysis should be made on the stores in the Western region to determine what the best sales strategy is and how it can be implemented in less profitable regions.
